# Luca's 3D models

this repo is a personal collection of 3D models i do for my self that i want to keep open source.

i'm in love with parametric models and openscad, but bear in mind i'm just starting 3D modeling so i can do a lot of rookie mistakes.

i'll also publish these models on makerworld, account @lucan
